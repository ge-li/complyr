Description: Unignorable confounding is no stranger even for randomized 
  controlled trials (RCTs) in the presence of treatment non-compliance. 
  One fallback is the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, which unfortunately 
  only reflects the assignment-induced causal effect. The celebrated 
  (Angrist, Imbens & Rubin 1996) framework provides an excellent platform 
  to tackle unmeasured confounding for estimating the complier (local) average 
  treatment effect (ATE). This package aims to provide a suite of tools for 
  analyzing different complier causal effects including ATE, quantile treatment
  effect (QTE), and probabilistic index.
